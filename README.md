# Discord Activity Tracker

This is a Discord bot and web service that tracks and displays user activity (like playing games or listening to music) within the Discord servers it is a part of. It uses `discord.js` to connect to Discord, `express` for the HTTP server, and stores user activities in a JSON file.

## Features

- Tracks user activities (games, music, etc.) on Discord.
- Provides a simple web API to query user activities.
- Saves user activities in a local `data.json` file.
- Automatically initializes and updates user activity data upon logging in or when a new member joins a server.

## API

### Get User Activities

You can get the last 4 activities of a user by sending a `GET` request to the following endpoint:

```
GET /user/:id/activities
```

- `:id` - The Discord user ID.

Example:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/user/123456789012345678/activities
```

Response example:

```json
{
  "activities": [
    { "name": "Game 1", "type": "Playing", "details": "Level 10" },
    { "name": "Game 2", "type": "Playing", "details": "Level 5" },
    { "name": "No data", "type": "No data", "details": "No data" },
    { "name": "No data", "type": "No data", "details": "No data" }
  ]
}
```

If no activity is found for the user, the response will return "No data".
